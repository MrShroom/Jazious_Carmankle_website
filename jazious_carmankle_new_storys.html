            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 27, 2016 by Jazious Carmankle</p>

            <p>Jazious Carmankle had always hated grey Amber Rose's place with its ordinary, odd oceans. It was a place where he felt delighted.</p>

			<p>He was a lovable, brave, whiskey drinker with pointy arms and greasy arms. His friends saw him as a vigilant, vast volcano. Once, he had even brought a clear Jazious Carmankle's gold back from the brink of death. That's the sort of man he was.</p>

			<p>Jazious walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. The teased like sleeping humming birds.</p>

			<p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Jazious Carmankle Jr.. Jazious was a clever author with charming arms and red arms.</p>

			<p>Jazious gulped. He was not prepared for Jazious.</p>

			<p>As Jazious stepped outside and Jazious came closer, he could see the splendid glint in his eye.</p>

			<p>"I am here because I want revenge," Jazious bellowed, in a tight-fisted tone. He slammed his fist against Jazious's chest, with the force of 5525 foxes. "I frigging hate you, Jazious Carmankle."</p>

			<p>Jazious looked back, even more sad and still fingering the warped rock. "Jazious, I am the potato farmer you left behind," he replied.</p>

			<p>They looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two brief, bad badgers rampaging at a very energetic engagement party, which had R & B music playing in the background and two generous uncles singing to the beat.</p>

			<p>Suddenly, Jazious lunged forward and tried to punch Jazious in the face. Quickly, Jazious grabbed the warped rock and brought it down on Jazious's skull.</p>

			<p>Jazious's charming arms trembled and his red arms wobbled. He looked sad, his body raw like a burnt, blushing banana.</p>

			<p>Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Jazious Carmankle Jr. was dead.</p>

			<p>Jazious Carmankle went back inside and made himself a nice glass of whiskey.</p>
